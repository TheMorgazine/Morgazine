<p>Friends and family gathered together at our house today to celebrate Elijah's fourth birthday, which was on Wednesday. For Elijah, it may have felt like he was celebrating two birthdays. Earlier this afternoon, he was overheard saying that in 30 days he would turn five.</p><p>Last night, Theresa baked a birthday cake for Elijah and decorated it with a "PJ Masks" theme. She split the cake into three sides, each a different color to represent one of the main characters from the PJ Masks show.</p><p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-115" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_2094-1-336x252.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="252" /></p><p>I left close to one o'clock to pick up the pizzas for the party. Unfortunately, when I arrived at Little Ceaser's, I learned that their "Internet was down," and they were accepting "Cash Only." This was a huge bummer since we were planning on paying with our debit card. So, I drive over to our bank, got the money, then drove back and placed the order for the pizza (and one side order of breadsticks, for Elijah).</p><p>On the way back through town, I stopped and picked up Josh at the Holidays where he had spent the night and had stayed the morning for Noah's birthday party. I was the last to arrive.</p><p>After eating our late lunch, we watched Elijah open his gifts. He was so excited when he opened up his first one, a stuffed Owelette, that he walked around carrying her as if he was totally done opening up presents. After some coaxing, he returned and opened up more. He was mesmerized by the money that came in one person's card. He counted each dollar, and concluded that there were 11 (there was 10).</p><p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-117" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_2118-1-336x252.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="252" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Elijah received a complete set of PJ Masks stuffies from us, clothes, money, sand toys, and a small lightsaber containing a bubble wand and bubble liquid. He was excited to see that the lightsaber lit up.</p><p>Next, we cut Elijah's birthday cake. It took a little while for him to blow out his candles, but eventually he got all of them with a little help from others.</p><p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-118" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_2125-336x252.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="252" /></p>

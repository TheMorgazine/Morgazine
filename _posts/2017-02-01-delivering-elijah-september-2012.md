<h2>The Origins of Doughnut Liberation Day</h2><p>Today we celebrated Doughnut Liberation day. This is basically a day where we spend a couple of hours at a bakery in Clare called Cops &amp; Doughnuts.</p><p>I’ve referred to this kind of visit as “Doughnut Liberation Day,” because I see our return trips to Cops &amp; Doughnuts as follow-up to the trip we made there about a year ago with the Hollidays and two of Kayla’s friends, Hannah and Hailey.</p><p>Prior to last September, I had heard about the Cops &amp; Doughnuts store, but I had never stopped there for donuts or to check out their souvenir shop. I actually hadn’t spent a lot of time in the city of Clare, other than passing through on the way up North, or attending a Job Fair which was held at the Doherty Hotel.</p><p>My first visit actually occurred earlier than September 2011. It was a day when we had lost power starting that morning, so while we were waiting for electricity to be restored Louie Holliday suggested that we go up North to attend a Family Carnival which was being held in Clare. He also mentioned the possibility of stopping at a few garage sales, and getting donuts. I’m not sure why, but Josh was the only one with me, and Louie had Athena with him. So, the four of us headed North towards Clare.</p><p>The carnival turned out to be not much fun, plus there was an admission fee, so we spent the majority of the time stopping at garage sales, where I picked up a really great set of bags and a computer case with a telescoping handle and wheels. One of our last stops was at Cops &amp; Doughnuts where we took a few minutes to eat a donut.</p><p>Well, I’m pretty sure that this trip quickly became a legend in the Holliday household, because after that whenever there was a slow moment, or an afternoon with downtime, or basically any kind of opportunity at all, Athena’s younger brother Noah would ask about going to Cops &amp; Doughnuts. He tried so hard and asked so often, you would think that he had never tasted a donut!</p><p>It was a Saturday late in September. The kids and I were still getting started for our day. Louie texted me asking me if I wanted to join them on a color tour up North. We were going to stop North of Clare, shop at Jay’s Sporting goods, and then eat at Cops &amp; Doughnuts.</p><p>I told him that it sounded like a good idea, and suggested to Kayla that she could bring a friend. She wanted to ask her friend from around the next corner, Hannah. I told her she could ask, but to please be quick because we were getting ready to leave with the Hollidays.</p><p>After a few minutes, Kayla returned with Hannah, and Hannah’s little sister Hailey who also wanted to go. I hadn’t counted on bringing a fourth person, but there didn’t seem to be any harm with it, and we were in a hurry, so I welcomed her to our little trip up North.</p><p>We climbed into our van, and pulled around to the Holliday’s house, where the Hollidays were also getting ready to leave. After a little bit of negotiating, we agreed to swap Josh for Athena so that all of the girls could ride together, and so that Josh could ride with Noah. On the way up North, I made the mistake of asking for music requests. The girls all asked for Hannah Montana music, so that’s what we listened to on the way up.</p><p><img class="wp-image-69" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/word-image-9.jpeg" /></p><p><em>Louie tells the kids about John Meyer</em></p><p><img class="wp-image-70" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/word-image-10.jpeg" /></p><p><em>The girls inside the Army Surplus store</em></p><p>Our first stop was at the former site of John “Spikehorn” Meyer’s house. There isn’t a lot that I can tell you about him, except that he maintained a sort of bear refuge behind his house. Thank goodness that Louie knew more about the history, because it allowed him to explain to the kids why the billboard-sized photo and the remaining structures were important.</p><p>After visiting the site of John Meyer’s former home, we headed South back towards Clare where we stopped at the Jay’s Sporting Goods store. Not much happened there, except I immediately realized what a mistake it was to take so many kids–four of them under my responsibility–into a gigantic retail store filled with guns, fishing poles, canoes, camping chairs…well, a whole lot of stuff, some of which was set out on display where kids could climb, touch, hold, poke, or swing around.</p><p>Louie’s wife, Jenny, summed it up the best when she walked out of the women’s bathroom, and told Louie that she didn’t want to be stuck with watching “all these kids.” I had always planned on staying in charge of the four that we brought, but it struck me as kind of funny.</p><p>On our way out of Jay’s Sporting Goods, we walked out to the back edge of the parking lot where people were selling puppies. Your brother and sister begged to get one, but I told them no. At the time we had a cat, so it didn’t seem practical.</p><p>Next, we visited the Army Surplus store which was next to Jay’s Sporting Goods. A store with army clothes, guns, bombs, and tents probably wasn’t much better for kids than Jay’s, but it was at least a little bit smaller.</p><p><img class="wp-image-71" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/word-image-11.jpeg" /></p><p><em>Kayla holding one of the puppies</em></p><p><img class="wp-image-72" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/word-image-12.jpeg" /></p><p><em>Me</em></p><p>Once we were done there, we got into our vehicles and finally headed for Cops &amp; Doughnuts.</p><p>The name Cops &amp; Doughnuts is a play on the stereotype that police officers like to stop at doughnut shops on their breaks. I couldn’t tell you if this is true or not, or even more true for police officers than, say, construction workers or computer programmers. Doughnuts are generally pretty popular with people, otherwise there wouldn’t be as many bakeries around that sold them.</p><p>At that time, Cops &amp; Doughnuts was separated into two main rooms. There was the bakery side where you could pick the donut that you wanted from the display case, and the souvenir side where you could sit and eat your donut, browse the shelves and racks filled with sourvenir clothes and knick knacks. There isn’t much that’s special about ordering the donuts on the bakery side, other than the fact that there are a lot of different kinds of donuts to choose from, plus the people who work there all wear uniforms that look like police uniforms. If I remember right, the bakery is actually owned and operated by two actual local police officers.</p><p>Well, the one thing that is unique about Cops &amp; Doughnuts when you are picking out donuts is that they have a specialty donut which they call the “‘Squealer.” Basically, its a donut that has bacon stuck onto the top of it. I’ve never tried it, but two of the kids who have joined us for visits to Cops &amp; Doughnuts have eaten them, and I think one of the adult Hollidays had one too.</p><p>The Souvenir, or retail side, of Cops &amp; Doughnuts has tables and chairs towards the front for eating your donut, Police officer paraphernalia along the sides, and towards the center there are racks with lots of Cops &amp; Doughnut branded clothing.</p><p>Along the left side of the room, there is a guest book where you can fill out your name, maps on the wall where you can insert a pin showing where you are from, and an area of the wall that has giant lines drawn on like the background of a mug shot. This is placed there so that people can take free, mugshots of each other. There is even a dry-erase board which can be used as a slate. You just fill in the blanks with your name, crime, etc.</p><p>So, as the people in our group finished eating our donuts they began to slowly spread out across the retail store side of Cops &amp; Doughnuts. There was a lot of clothes and police gear on display. The kids took turns having their mug shots taken. Josh and Noah disappeared for a little bit.</p><p>When Noah re-materialized a little bit, he pointed out that he had put on a pair of handcuffs to make his next mugshot more realistic. At first, we were all a little surprised, but this quickly turned to concern when Noah’s parents started to realize that the handcuffs were, indeed, locked around his wrists and there didn’t seem to be a key visible.</p><p>They asked for help from the employees, and that’s when we learned that there wasn’t actually a key for the handcuffs. By this time, Noah was pretty scared and upset because it was taking so long to remove the handcuffs.</p><p>An officer from the Clare Police Department responded to an inquiry from the Cops &amp; Doughnuts staff, but as it turned out they also didn’t have keys for the handcuffs. Eventually, Noah and his parents were driven to the police department where someone used bolt cutters to remove the handcuffs from Noah’s wrists.</p><p>We returned a couple of times after that, and before long I began to think that these visits to Cops &amp; Doughnuts should be a somewhat regular thing. The incident with the handcuffs were so memorable (especially for Noah) that I thought it would be cool to reference it in some kind of holiday-like sounding name.</p><p>So, I thought of “Doughnut Liberation Day.”</p><p>Subsequent visits were pleasant but not quite as eventful. I now have quite a few volumes of photos taken in front of the “Mugshot wall,” with the kids holding a slate describing fake crimes.</p><p><!--more--></p><h2>This is Shepherd</h2><p>This week your mom discovered that her stomach has gotten big enough that it gets in her way when she tries to wash the dishes. So, that most likely means two important things:</p><ol><li>You’re getting bigger; and</li><li>I’m probably going to need to do the dishes more often until you’re born</li></ol><p>Your brother and sister just finished up their first week of school. Actually, they didn’t start school until Tuesday so it wasn’t a full week, but it’s still quite an accomplishment. I have a feeling that things will be a little bit different on Sunday when they are going to bed knowing that they will have a full week of school ahead of them.</p><p>I don’t think we could have picked a community with a better school district. For the most part, we’ve had some good luck with teachers. Kayla really liked choir last year, and although there is a new choir director I think she will have fun again this year.</p><p>There wasn’t any particular reason why we ended up living in Shepherd. At the time, we were living in West Lansing but I was commuting to Mount Pleasant each weekday. Your sister, Kayla, was just a little more than a year old at the time. Your mom was pregnant with Josh when we moved.</p><p>So, we shopped around for an apartment in the area, and happened to find a two bedroom that was available on Tara Court. If I remember right, the landlord was extra nice to us because I worked for Special Olympics Michigan.</p><p>Moving to Shepherd changed everything. I realized this the same day that we moved most of our stuff into the new apartment when I took your sister on a walk towards the center of the Village. There was a park within walking distance, and of course some stores. Lansing is jammed packed with parks, museums, a baseball stadium, and a zoo, but we never really took advantage of them. We just never felt like we fit in there, but I think that both your mom and I instantly felt comfortable here.</p><p>The hardest part about being away from my hometown is that I don’t really have a legacy here. In Hartland, there are people from my neighborhood, former classmates I graduated with, and evidence of my ancestry. Here, nobody has ever really heard of the Morgans, Cornells, or the Parshalls.</p><p>In away, this has been a good thing because it has given me the chance to have a fresh start with people. I don’t have a checkered past, or anything, but sometimes its better not to be surrounded by people who knew you when you were in elementary school.</p><p>One thing that I’ve learned from being the “New Kid” on the block is that it just takes a little extra effort to put yourself out there so that people can get to know you. It can be daunting to be in a room where nobody knows you, but the fastest way to get passed that is to meet at least five people.</p><p>I don’t think that you’ll have any trouble meeting new people or making new friends, because between your mom, me, and your siblings, you will constantly be surrounded by people who want to meet you. (And, it wouldn’t hurt if they sometimes offered to change a diaper, too)</p><p>There has been a lot of improvements made since we moved here. The water tower has gotten a fresh coating of paint, for example. Not a huge influence on my life, but its a little better to look at when we drive through town.</p><p>Back in 2007, during Shepherd’s Sesquicentennial Celebration, a group of art students from the high school painted a mural onto the side of the train car in front of the train depot (don’t worry, they had permission). It turned out really nice, and its still there. Did I mention that there is a Train Depot? This was a favorite destination for your brother and sister when they were younger (Thomas the Train was really big in each of their lives back then, so it worked out that we lived close to the railroad tracks).</p><p>One thing that we have now that wasn’t there when your brother was a baby is a walking trail that loops around behind the schools now. The three of us attended the grand opening, when they served free hot dogs and gave a tour around the tral to show us what it would look like.</p><p>The Shepherd schools went through some remodeling. Shepherd now has a brand-new auditorium that’s almost as spiffy as the one that Hartland built during my Senior year of high school (Okay, its most likely better, but still doesn’t have a band pit, like ours did). After five years watching elementary school concerts in the gymnasium, the auditorium seats feel like heaven.</p><p>And, finally, Shepherd has a brand new community library. This is one of the newest developments. We didn’t take enough advantage of the programs that the library here has for younger children back when Kayla and Josh were younger, but I hope to find out more after you’re born. Well, maybe I’ll wait until you’re at least a year old.</p><p>So that’s just a quick preview of what will be waiting for you to discover after you are born. Shepherd might be snow-covered in February, so it might be two or three months before we can spend too much time outside (Which reminds me, Shepherd has a hill next to Salt River Park that you can go sledding down during the winter–definitely something you will need to try as soon as you’re old enough).</p><p>Well, that’s just about everything that I wanted to share for tonight. After I’m done writing this entry, I’ll be spending a few minutes in the kitchen before I can get to bed.</p><p>I have some dirty dishes to clean.</p><p><!--more--></p><h2>Ultrasound</h2><p><strong>Theresa Morgan</strong></p><p>Update: Ultrasound is scheduled for Jon’s Birthday, Sept 24th, if baby cooperates we’ll hopefully find out if it’ll be pink or blue! Heart rate was 154 today and the little one took a good swift kick at the dopplar when doc was listening. LOL Also it was confirmed I do have an umbilical hernia about an inch and a half in diameter at the moment. Hopefully it doesn’t get any worse than it is now. But it’s a “just have to deal with it” issue at the moment.</p><p><em>September 10, 2012</em></p><h2><a id="post-59-_b7i3rc2cizle"></a>Comments</h2><p><strong>Jenni Van Heck-Black</strong> I hope the umbilical hernia thing dont get worst. Good Luck</p><p><!--more--></p><h2>Jon Morgan Shared an image - September 18, 2012</h2><p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-78" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/image01-336x252.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="252" /></p><p><!--more--></p><h1><a id="post-59-_li1wqbxgjs56"></a>A Month of Birthdays</h1><p>We’re celebrating one birthday after another this month. On Sunday, the kids and I took your mom out for dinner at Applebee’s and surprised her with a gift certificate to Celebration Cinemas. It took a little bit of thinking, but I finally realized that she had a lot of movie watching in her near future thanks to the release of the latest and (finally) very last “Twilight” movie.</p><p>Your sister also made your mom a gift card for an endless supply of hugs, which I thought was really sweet. Fortunately, Kayla is always ready to give you a hug whether you have a coupon or not.</p><p>It’s important to mention that some of your relatives are also celebrate birthdays this week. Your Uncle Alan had his birthday on Saturday, and your Aunt Amy, who is my sister, will be celebrating her birthday on the 20th.</p><p>Then, your sister will be celebrating her 12th birthday with family this upcoming Saturday. I can barely even believe that she is that old. Her birthday is on the 23rd of September.</p><p>And, finally, there is my birthday, which is on the 24th. I don’t know why it is, but between my sister growing up, Kayla, and your mom, it seems like I’ve always been destined to share my birthday with everybody else! Well, its actually pretty neat.</p><p>Your brother will be turning ten on November 11. For most of the time, he was the lone wolf of the family because he was the only one with a birthday that wasn’t in September, but I guess now you’ll pick up that honor. Don’t worry, I don’t think he’ll mind.</p><p>One gift that I know that I will be getting on my birthday is another opportunity to see you via ultrasound, and most likely we will be able to finally learn if you are going to be a boy or a girl. It definitely will make writing these blog posts a lot easier!</p><p><!--more--></p><h2>Kayla's 12th Birthday</h2><p><em>Jon Morgan shared Theresa Morgan’s status.</em></p><p><strong>Theresa Morgan</strong></p><p>Had a short, but fun weekend celebrating Kayla’s 12th birthday and my childhood churches 150th. Now tomorrow is Jon’s 38th birthday and ultrasound day.

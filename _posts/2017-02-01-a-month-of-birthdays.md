<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re celebrating one birthday after another this month. On Sunday, the kids and I took your mom out for dinner at Applebee’s and surprised her with a gift certificate to Celebration Cinemas. It took a little bit of thinking, but I finally realized that she had a lot of movie watching in her near future thanks to the release of the latest and (finally) very last “Twilight” movie.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your sister also made your mom a gift card for an endless supply of hugs, which I thought was really sweet. Fortunately, Kayla is always ready to give you a hug whether you have a coupon or not.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to mention that some of your relatives are also celebrate birthdays this week. Your Uncle Alan had his birthday on Saturday, and your Aunt Amy, who is my sister, will be celebrating her birthday on the 20th.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, your sister will be celebrating her 12th birthday with family this upcoming Saturday. I can barely even believe that she is that old. Her birthday is on the 23rd of September.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, finally, there is my birthday, which is on the 24th. I don’t know why it is, but between my sister growing up, Kayla, and your mom, it seems like I’ve always been destined to share my birthday with everybody else! Well, its actually pretty neat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your brother will be turning ten on November 11. For most of the time, he was the lone wolf of the family because he was the only one with a birthday that wasn’t in September, but I guess now you’ll pick up that honor. Don’t worry, I don’t think he’ll mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One gift that I know that I will be getting on my birthday is another opportunity to see you via ultrasound, and most likely we will be able to finally learn if you are going to be a boy or a girl. It definitely will make writing these blog posts a lot easier!</span></p>

<p>My grandfather, Chancy Cornell, told the story about Charles Lindbergh turning down alcohol. When offered a sip, he turned his glass over. My Grandpa Cornell had a lot of integrity. He didn’t drink alcohol, he saved money, he never liked to be in debt. He declined novocaine when he visited the dentist.</p><p>It was always extra special to spend the night over at my Grandma and Grandpa Cornell’s house. They lived just ten minutes away from my house, so it wasn’t a matter of being away from home. And, their house wasn’t really child friendly, so it’s not I could do much there that I wouldn’t have been able to do at home. Still it was a special privilege.</p><p>One thing that I could do when I stayed the night is go up to “the storage” where my grandfather would feed his cows at night. Back then, he was a farmer, an apple grower, and he kept livestock like cows and sheep.</p><p>My Grandmother Cornell was the only force in the universe which could change my mom’s mind. This especially worked to our advantage when we were shopping. My sister and I would complain about feeling hungry, but our mom would downplay our needs and insist on making another stop at a store. It was our Grandma Cornell who would say, “Now, Sandy, the kids are hungry.” I don’t know if that always worked, but she was like a powerful advocate.</p><p>When we went shopping with our grandmother, this meant that my grandfather would be left at home to “fend for himself.” He wasn’t much of a cook at all. He would snack on saltine crackers and we often found him sleeping in his chair in front of the television.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

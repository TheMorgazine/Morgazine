We had a late start in the morning, but were soon making plans to go to the Boo Bash. Your mom and sister were in Grand Rapids for Kayla’s Halloween on Ice rehearsal, so it was going to be just the three of us.</p><p>Josh wanted to go to the Chippewa District Library in Mount Pleasant. We had movies to return, and he wanted to rent some more episodes for the latest anime that he’s gotten interested in. I wasn’t sure if we were going to make it there, and knew that somewhere we would want to squeeze in your nap, so I was on the fence. I actually would have preferred to go to the library here in Shepherd and call it good.</p><p>On the way to the library, you said something about picking out a leaf. There were definitely enough leaves on the ground to choose from. A lot of the trees we walked by had patches of bare branches because they had lost so many leaves, and some parts of the sidewalk were covered with leaves. You picked a leaf up from the ground. I asked you what color it was, and you said it was brown. On our way by the new computer shop, you stopped to set the brown leaf onto the doorstep.</p><p>As soon as we entered the library, and before I finished turning in the DVDs, you were already getting out an airplane, truck, and car to play with on the table in the back. I sat down on the couch nearby, and you ran over to the cityscape mat on the floor. You dove the truck around what you called the “lake path,” which I believe was the blue border around the mat that looked like it was a part of the lake.</p><p>Then, you got out the toy clock. Each number on the face of the clock is on a different shape block which can be removed. Before you got too involved with the clock, I asked you if you would put the toy vehicles away, and you did.</p><p>From then on, you carried each of the shapes from the clock over to me and made them dance and sing their part of the “Shapes Song.” Each part went something like this: “I am a triangle, triangle, triangle….” You were so into it, that although I originally planned on being at the library for only a little bit I didn’t have the heart to leave until you were done.</p><p>Next, you wanted to play on the kids’ computer up against the very back wall, but this was when I decided we should head back home. I was hungry for lunch, and wanted to feed you so there was enough time for a nap.</p><p><img title="null" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12175990_10153051835022665_1053862669_o.jpg" alt="12175990_10153051835022665_1053862669_o.jpg" width="624" height="832" /></p><p><img title="null" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12181035_10153051835457665_867592227_o.jpg" alt="12181035_10153051835457665_867592227_o.jpg" width="624" height="832" /></p><p><img title="null" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12176054_10153051835657665_1095689826_o.jpg" alt="12176054_10153051835657665_1095689826_o.jpg" width="624" height="832" /></p><p>On our way back home, you stopped and retrieved the brown leaf. You found another leaf you liked, and even began to hand me some so that your hands were free for more.</p><p>Shortly after we got home, it started to rain really hard. Josh and I had been getting ready to leave for Mount Pleasant but the rain slowed us down. The rainwater was forming a deep puddle which surrounded your mom’s car, so it would have been impossible to get your stroller out of the trunk without standing in water. I pulled her car around and parked it behind mind so I could move your stroller. Then, I returned your mom’s car to its spot.</p><p>By this time, your brother had a headache and said that he didn’t want to go to the library. With Josh not feeling well, I decided that we should forget about going to the library, get you down for a nap, and then focus on going to the Boo Bash.</p><p>I laid you down on your bed and read to you “The Little Engine that Could,” and “Duck and Goose find a pumpkin.” We have several “Duck and Goose” stories, so I made up a theme song I sing before I read each book. The sillier I make it, the more it makes you laugh when I sing it. After I was done, I told you that I’d see you later, but you said that you weren’t going to lay down. I said you needed the quiet time, and left you to take your nap.</p><p>Eventually, your brother began to feel better. It was 5:30 p.m. and the Boo Bash had started, but I had wanted to wait as long as I could to wake you up, and didn’t want to take Josh somewhere when he wasn’t feeling well. But, your big brother gave me the “thumbs up” on going, and you woke up while I was looking for your costume.</p><p>At this point, I figured that we would be only “fashionable late,” and would perhaps avoid the initial crowd that usually arrived before the event started. We also had another reason to go to the Boo Bash: your mom and sister were on their way back from Grand Rapids and would be going directly to the ice arena. The plan was that they would be riding home with us, so we needed to be there.</p><p>I changed your diaper and began to dress you in the lion costume that your mom had gotten for Halloween this year. Almost as soon as you saw it, you began to cry and fuss, and fought me the entire time that I was slipping your legs into the leg holes, etc. I had you entirely inside the Lion costume but you immediately began to pull at it trying to take it off. I took you into the bathroom to show you what you looked like in the lion costume (“So cute!”) but it only made you cry worse.</p><p>Eventually, you managed to strip the whole thing off of you then ran into my bedroom and climbed into my bed. I gave the both of us a little breather. Eventually I tried again, and you managed to keep the costume on. I finished getting ready, and we headed for the ice arena. We weren’t going to have very much time.</p><p>The good news was that the line was a lot shorter, and it didn’t take us long to get up stairs where they were handing out candy. The bad news was that we were still in line, and it took forever to get through all of the tables.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img title="null" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/103_7968.jpg" alt="103_7968.JPG" width="624" height="468" /></p><p><img title="null" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/103_7976.jpg" alt="103_7976.JPG" width="624" height="468" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img title="null" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/103_7974.jpg" alt="103_7974.JPG" width="624" height="468" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We met up with your mom and your sister. On our way home from the arena, we picked up a pizza from Hungry Howies for a late dinner. While I was placing the order, your mom texted me that you had asked for breadsticks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>/ <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NOD9xXlVuhdAj6jmGMGJo8QuiYziG7tM5Qu6GNtzWk/edit?usp=sharing">Post a Comment</a> / <a href="https://medium.com/elijah-j-morgan/the-boo-bash-2015-bb9939e4733#.ewxpcr2dv">Respond via Medium</a> / <a href="mailto:themorgazine.inbox@gmail.com">Respond via Email</a> /</p>

<p><b>Theresa Morgan</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update: Ultrasound is scheduled for Jon’s Birthday, Sept 24th, if baby cooperates we’ll hopefully find out if it’ll be pink or blue! Heart rate was 154 today and the little one took a good swift kick at the dopplar when doc was listening. LOL Also it was confirmed I do have an umbilical hernia about an inch and a half in diameter at the moment. Hopefully it doesn’t get any worse than it is now. But it’s a “just have to deal with it” issue at the moment.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">September 10, 2012</span></i></p><h2><b>Comments</b></h2><p><b>Jenni Van Heck-Black</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I hope the umbilical hernia thing dont get worst. Good Luck</span></p>

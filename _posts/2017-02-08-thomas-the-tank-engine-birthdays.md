<p>Here is a post from my wife last year pointing out that all of our kids have had "Thomas the Tank Engine" themed birthday parties, complete with a Thomas cake. I'm still waiting for one of them to ask for a Star Wars themed party. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-135" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Elijah_thomascake-336x252.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="252" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-136" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Josh_thomascake-336x252.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="252" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-137" src="http://morgazine.shepherdhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kayla_thomascake-336x252.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="252" /></p>
